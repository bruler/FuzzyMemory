You’ll find that\n      all those “hard” things aren’t so difficult after all, and your code\n      will run orders of magnitude faster.\n      </p>"], ["image_url", "adrpo.jpg"], ["price", #<BigDecimal:559a5ef0cb18,'0.46E2',9(18)>], ["created_at", 2016-12-08 20:01:48 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-12-08 20:01:48 UTC]]
